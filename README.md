*** Simple Web Development Project ***
 * Author: Peter Baggetta

*** How to run the program ***
 - Open the backend in your choice of editor that is able to run java 
 - The compiler attached to the backend is Maven, with Intellij all you need to do it click the run button

 - Open the front end in your choice of editor for React/javascript
 - I used VSCode to create the entire front end and used npm to run the program

 - The database used to store the data for this program is MongoDb and was linked with Spring Boot in the backend

*** Files Missing from GitHub ***
 - Within the backend folder, there is a file that is supposed to be named 'resources' within 'main' that is called application.properties.
 - The application.properties file is supposed to contain the 'spring.data.mongodb.uri' and the 'spring.data.mongodb.database'

*** About the website developed ***
 - The program developed uses a variety of buttons, textboxes, forms, and many other components to help create the input and frontend. It is a website that allows you to enter in items with an id (string), name (string), quantity (number), and category (string) to then add it to the database.

 - The different drop down menus on the left side of the website allow for different searches of items either by name or category, update an items quantity, delete from the database, and a way for the user to see all the items in the database on the frontend.

 - The website is simple to use and is intuitive and is minimal in its style.
